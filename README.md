# learn_arduino
Im will be trying to learn arduino. I got ESP32 as my first hardware.

First of all, arduino has 2 main function:
setup = run once
loop = run forever (to detect things or just simply keep running)

Arduino used to build IOT products. Wow this is cool. I can automate my life???

Day 1:
- First of all, install the board driver. I am using ESP32-S3-WROOM-1. I dont know what it do right now, but it sure is cool.
