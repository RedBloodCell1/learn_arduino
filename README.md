# learn_arduino
Im will be trying to learn arduino. I got ESP32 as my first hardware.

First of all, arduino has 2 main function:
setup = run once
loop = run forever (to detect things or just simply keep running)

Arduino used to build IOT products. Wow this is cool. I can automate my life???

Day 1:
- First of all, install the board driver. I am using ESP32-S3-WROOM-1. I dont know what it do right now, but it sure is cool.
- I am having a hard time figuring out what board this is and how to upload code and there is a lot of error. Please help me :')

Day 2:
Im officially depressed. Yayy, can i really finish my thesis? Can i really do this? I changed yet again. Now im dumb again. But i know at the end i need to finish everything and everything and that's why i will finish it. Im lazy, this laziness come from depression and fear of failing, but once again, i know that at the end i need to finish the thing i started and thats why i need to start doing things. But it is so hard and i don't wanna do it anymore. Should i be counter productive? Nah. I will learn arduino tutorial today. Frick it.
  
Day 3:
I just came back from my holiday and after that im sick. Now im back to work. no BS i will just do it.
The problem is only installing esp32 ble library. Once i delete that library, the code work just fine. I just need to set up a BLE server. And i just use the example code. It kinda bugs me how long it took me to understand all of the simple thing. But here i am feeling acomplished just by simply using the example code and somehow it works. I will put the link to the error that happen to me.

error: 'ringbuf_type_t' has not been declared
